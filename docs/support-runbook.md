# Support runbook

This document describes possible ways in which the system may fail or malfunction, with instructions how to handle and recover from these scenarios.

This runbook is supplementary to the [general 24/7 support runbook](https://intranet.torchbox.com/propositions/design-and-build-proposition/delivering-projects/dedicated-support-team/247-support-out-of-hours-runbook/), with details about project-specific actions which may be necessary for troubleshooting and restoring service.

See also our [incident process](https://intranet.torchbox.com/propositions/design-and-build-proposition/delivering-projects/application-support/incident-process/) if you're not already following this.

**Note: Remove the above intranet references if this project will be supported by the client's team, or handed to a third party for support. Consider whether to incorporate any scenarios from the general runbook in these cases.**

## Enquire to study form throwing 500s:

### 1. Check the data

The enquire to study form has 2 integrations:

1. Form data from user outside UK is sent to 'QS'
2. Form data from user inside UK is sent to Mailchimp

The programme values the user select on the form have 'qs_code` values in Wagtail. As do some of the taxonomies. These 'qs_codes' and to lookup data from the QS endpoint. Usually the form throws 500s if these values change on the QS side but aren't updated in Wagtail. You can view the QS endpoint and inspect what codes a course should have - the endpoint is set as an env var in heroku.

If it turns out a programme/course has the wrong QS code, update it in wagtail with the right one from the endpoint.
