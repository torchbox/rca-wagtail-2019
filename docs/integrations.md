# Integrations

## Azure AD SSO

To add SSO functionality, we used `social-auth-app-django`. All of the configurations and necessary keys can be seen in the `Azure AD (SSO)` and `Social Auth (SSO)` sections in the base settings. Logging in via SSO is optional. Users can still login via the standard Wagtail login form.
